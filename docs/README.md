# Greywall Documentation

Greywall is a sandboxing tool that restricts network and filesystem access for arbitrary commands. It's most useful for running semi-trusted code (package installs, build scripts, CI jobs, unfamiliar repos) with controlled side effects.

## Getting Started

- [Quickstart](quickstart.md) - Install greywall and run your first sandboxed command in 5 minutes
- [Why Greywall](why-greywall.md) - What problem it solves (and what it doesn't)

## Guides

- [Concepts](concepts.md) - Mental model: OS sandbox + local proxies + config
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) - Common failure modes and fixes
- [Using Greywall with AI agents](agents.md) - Defense-in-depth and policy standardization
- [Recipes](recipes/README.md) - Common workflows (npm/pip/git/CI)
- [Templates](./templates.md) - Copy/paste templates you can start from
