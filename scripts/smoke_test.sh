# smoke_test.sh - Run smoke tests against the greywall binary
#
# This script tests the compiled greywall binary to ensure basic functionality works.
# Unlike integration tests (which test internal APIs), smoke tests verify the
# final artifact behaves correctly.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/smoke_test.sh [path-to-greywall-binary]
#
# If no path is provided, it will look for ./greywall or use 'go run'.
